I had some trouble with the initial set up of this so there may be some text files in this repository that seem out of place.
-- Fixed this. Should no longer see anything weird.

In trying to get the google icons to display properly I came across something called CSS spriting (I think) it's apparently this idea that
you have a background image and then the size and position will display the piece of the image you want. 
I would prefer using actual icons in the future. 
I've made an exception since it took me so long to figure out how to do it and to get the image I want.
